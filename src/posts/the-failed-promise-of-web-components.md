In her article Vera writes about the actual idea and the current status of Web Components. She refers to reviews and critics by Jeremy Keith, the author of [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/). She questions the implicitness of vast amounts of dependencies, complex builds and the absolutely necessary use of JavaScript, e.g. the imperative use of Shadow DOM. Enough said, here is the link to Vera's article.
